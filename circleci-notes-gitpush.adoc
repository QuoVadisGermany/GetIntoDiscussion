It seems likely that you have more than one SSH key, and the key that's being presented is a deploy key for the repository rather than one of your account's keys with write permissions. There are two ways of dealing with this:

Remove all keys from your SSH agent, and re-add just the correct account key.



ssh-add -D
ssh-add /path/to/correct/key
Use HTTPS instead of SSH. You can do this easily by changing the remote URL for origin to use the HTTPS scheme instead of SSH.

One or the other of these should work, unless you are simply presenting the wrong credentials altogether.
